\section{Introduction}

Financial conditions indices (FCIs) are widely used by policy makers and practitioners, and are also increasingly common in the academic literature. However, FCIs are largely empirically motivated and lack a solid link to economic theory. In this paper, we propose an FCI that is the market price of risk in the economy under general circumstances and estimate it as the conditional volatility of GDP spanned by financial factors. We call this FCI the VFCI, or Volatility-FCI.
